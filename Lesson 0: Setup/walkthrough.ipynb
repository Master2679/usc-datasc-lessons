Replace \"username\" with your actual username, and modify the path as needed to match the installation destination of your miniconda instance. Save and exit the file. Restart your terminal and run ```conda --version```. If you see a version number, you have successfully added Miniconda to your PATH. Finally, run ```conda init``` and ```source ~/.zshrc``` to complete the process."
